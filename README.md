Introduction
Short stories or tales always help us in understanding a concept better but this is a true story, Wal-Mart’s beer diaper parable. A sales person from Wal-Mart tried to increase the sales of the store by bundling the products together and giving discounts on them. He bundled bread and jam which made it easy for a customer to find them together. Furthermore, customers could buy them together because of the discount.

To find some more opportunities and more such products that can be tied together, the sales guy analyzed all sales records. What he found was intriguing. Many customers who purchased diapers also bought beers. The two products are obviously unrelated, so he decided to dig deeper. He found that raising kids is grueling. And to relieve stress, parents imprudently decided to buy beer. He paired diapers with beers and the sales escalated. This is a perfect example of Association Rules in data mining.

This article takes you through a beginner's level explanation of Apriori algorithm in data mining. We will also look at the definition of association rules. Toward the end, we will look at the pros and cons of the Apriori algorithm along with its R implementation.

Let’s begin by understanding what Apriori algorithm is and why is it important to learn it.

Apriori Algorithm
With the quick growth in e-commerce applications, there is an accumulation vast quantity of data in months not in years. Data Mining, also known as Knowledge Discovery in Databases(KDD), to find anomalies, correlations, patterns, and trends to predict outcomes.

Apriori algorithm is a classical algorithm in data mining. It is used for mining frequent itemsets and relevant association rules. It is devised to operate on a database containing a lot of transactions, for instance, items brought by customers in a store.

It is very important for effective Market Basket Analysis and it helps the customers in purchasing their items with more ease which increases the sales of the markets. It has also been used in the field of healthcare for the detection of adverse drug reactions. It produces association rules that indicates what all combinations of medications and patient characteristics lead to ADRs.
